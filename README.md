# ruby-projects

A really great resource I came across was App Academy Open. This course walked me through an software engineering fundamentals. This is a collection of projects and lessons from App Academy's curriculum.

With the help of this resource, I got a strong introduction to test driven development and it helped further my knowledge of object-oriented programming.

I loved learning about loops, recursion, and classes. Ruby is one of my favourite languages!
