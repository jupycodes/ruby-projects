# ruby-projects

A really great resource I stumbled across was App Academy Open. This course walked me through an software engineering fundamentals. This is a collection of projects and lessons from App Academy's curriculum.

I loved learning about loops, recursion, and classes. Ruby might also be my favourite language!
